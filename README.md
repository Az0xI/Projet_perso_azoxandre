## What is this project ?

This project is a fangame of Arknights, a _tower Defense/ Visual Novel/ Gacha._  
It is one of my favourite game and i wanted to make it more strategical than it already is with a turn-based game like Darkest Dungeons  
I'm making it with Ncurses so don't expect anything miracullous with the graphics  

## How to play it ?
